To support smaller twitch streamers, viewers can make a purchase through an affiliate link. 

Install and use instructions:
1) Download the file and run the installer autoaffili\installers\win\Output\autoaffili-installer-0.1.0.exe"
2) Start OBS. On first run, a Twitch authorization prompt will open (Device Code flow).
   - Approve access so the bot can post messages in your chat.
   - Tokens are saved to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\autoaffili\twitch_tokens.json`.
3) Start your stream and mention a product. The bot posts an Amazon general search query link in chat that relates to your product mention.
4) When a viewer clicks on the link and makes a purchase within 24 hours (set by amazon) you will be rewarded with a commission.
5) 100% Commission will be donated via twitch or other available donation options on your channel.
