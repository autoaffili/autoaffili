This project is no longer supported or functional.  

To support smaller twitch streamers, viewers can make a purchase through an affiliate link. 

Install and use instructions:
1) Go to https://github.com/autoaffili/autoaffili/releases/tag/0.1.1
2) Download the autoaffili installer exe and run it. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may appear, click "More info", then "Run anyway".
3) Start OBS. On first run, a Twitch authorization prompt will open (Device Code flow). Approve access so the bot can post messages in your chat.
4) Start your stream and mention a product. The bot posts an Amazon general search query link in chat that relates to your product mention.
6) When a viewer clicks on the link and makes a purchase within 24 hours (set by amazon) you will be rewarded with a commission.
6) 100% Commission will be donated via twitch or other available donation options on your channel.

At the moment only for viewers in USA, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, UK, Italy.
